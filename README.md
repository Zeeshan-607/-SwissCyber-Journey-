### Day 3 – Dec 9, 2025 ✅
- Continued the “Careers in Cyber” room and understood the difference between Security Analyst, Penetration Tester, and Security Engineer.
- Explored the Pre Security, Cyber Security 101, and SOC Level 1 paths on TryHackMe and wrote notes about what each path teaches.

- Started understanding how roles like SOC Analyst and other blue‑team positions fit inside a real SOC environment.

- ### Day 5 – Dec 11, 2025 ✅
- Studied the purpose and main components of a Security Operations Center (SOC): detecting and responding to security incidents.
- Learned the three core pillars of a SOC in more detail: People (analysts and teams), Process (playbooks and workflows), and Technology (SIEM, EDR, and other tools).
- Started to understand how these three pillars work together to monitor, detect, and respond to cyber threats in real organisations.

### Day 7 – Dec 13, 2025 ✅
- Learned about the roles of an Incident Responder and a Digital Forensics Examiner and how they handle and investigate security incidents.
- Studied what a Malware Analyst does, including analysing malicious files and understanding how malware behaves.
- Reviewed the responsibilities of a Penetration Tester and how this offensive role helps organisations find and fix vulnerabilities.

- ### Day 8 – Dec 14, 2025 ✅
- Learned about the Red Teamer role and how it fits into offensive security.
- Reviewed the responsibilities and learning paths for a junior penetration tester (the “Offensive Security Intro” and “Defensive Security Intro” rooms were shown again, so I skipped them this time as I had seen them earlier).
- In the “Offensive Pentester” section, completed the introduction and learned about vulnerability assessment and the limitations of penetration testers.

### Day 9 – Dec 15, 2025 ✅
- Successfully installed Kali Linux and ran my first basic terminal commands to get comfortable with the environment.
- Completed the “Red Team Engagements” content and learned how red teams plan and execute realistic attack simulations.
- Finished the “Starting Your First Machine” section on TryHackMe, gaining confidence in connecting to and interacting with target machines.

### Day 10 – Dec 16, 2025 ✅
- Completed the “Red Team Engagements” room in Red Team Fundamentals and learned about how red‑team operations are planned and executed.
- Studied the “Teams and Functions of an Engagement” and “Engagement Structure” sections to understand who does what during a red‑team engagement.
- Faced some issues while using Linux in Kali, but successfully solved them while practising basic terminal commands (navigation, creating and removing files/folders).

### Day 11 – Dec 17, 2025 ✅
- Completed the full “Careers in Cyber” room on TryHackMe, including the final section on the Red Teamer role and the closing quiz.
- Revised the different career paths (SOC analyst, security engineer, incident responder, malware analyst, penetration tester, and red teamer) and how they fit together in the cyber security ecosystem.
- Planned to start focused networking studies from tomorrow to strengthen my core fundamentals for future cyber security work.

### Day 12 – Dec 18, 2025 ✅
- Started the “What is Networking?” topic and learned the basic definitions of networking and what a network is.
- Answered all the related questions in the TryHackMe room and reached 18% overall progress in the networking path.
- Began building my core networking foundation, which will directly support my future cyber security learning and labs.

### Day 13 – Dec 19, 2025 ✅
- Learned about identifying devices on a network and how different hosts appear in a network environment.
- Practised “changing my IP address” in a TryHackMe room and understood why IP changes can matter in hacking and defence scenarios.
- Solved all 5 questions inside that room, reinforcing my understanding of basic networking and IP concepts.
