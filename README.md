### Day 11 – Dec 17, 2025 ✅
- Completed the full “Careers in Cyber” room on TryHackMe, including the final section on the Red Teamer role and the closing quiz.
- Revised the different career paths (SOC analyst, security engineer, incident responder, malware analyst, penetration tester, and red teamer) and how they fit together in the cyber security ecosystem.
- Planned to start focused networking studies from tomorrow to strengthen my core fundamentals for future cyber security work.

### Day 12 – Dec 18, 2025 ✅
- Started the “What is Networking?” topic and learned the basic definitions of networking and what a network is.
- Answered all the related questions in the TryHackMe room and reached 18% overall progress in the networking path.
- Began building my core networking foundation, which will directly support my future cyber security learning and labs.

### Day 13 – Dec 19, 2025 ✅
- Learned about identifying devices on a network and how different hosts appear in a network environment.
- Practised “changing my IP address” in a TryHackMe room and understood why IP changes can matter in hacking and defence scenarios.
- Solved all 5 questions inside that room, reinforcing my understanding of basic networking and IP concepts.

### Day 14 – Dec 20, 2025 ✅
- Faced performance and storage issues with my dual-boot Kali Linux setup and spent time troubleshooting them until Kali ran smoothly again.
- Learned more about managing a dual-boot system and why a stable Linux setup is important for cyber security practice.
- Continued the “Ping” networking room on TryHackMe and completed it up to 81%, improving my understanding of how ping works to test connectivity between devices.

### Day 15 – Dec 21, 2025 ✅
- Completed the Ping (ICMP) room and learned how ICMP is used for connectivity testing and basic troubleshooting.
- Finished the “Intro to LAN” section, understanding how local area networks are structured, how devices communicate inside a LAN, and why this is important for cyber security.

### Day 16 – Dec 22, 2025 ✅
- Completed the LAN section 
- Learned about how devices are grouped into networks and how IP ranges are used to define those networks.
- Improved my understanding of how network types and ranges affect communication and security inside a LAN.

### Day 17 – Dec 23, 2025 ✅
- Spent the day revising my previous networking and Linux topics to strengthen my fundamentals.

### Day 18 – Dec 24, 2025 ✅
- Started studying the OSI model and began understanding how the 7 layers (from Physical up to Application) help structure networking concepts.
- Revised basic Linux commands in Kali and practised working with files and directories to get more comfortable with the terminal.
- Practised the new Linux commands in Kali, and today I was able to remember three of them without looking at my notes just by running them in the terminal.

### Day 19 – Dec 25, 2025 ✅
- Successfully ran more Linux terminal commands in Kali, including `ls -la`, `ls -sl`, `history`, and `clear`, and started feeling more comfortable working inside the shell.

### Day 20 – Dec 26, 2025 ✅
- Watched a video about “5 mistakes to avoid as a cybersecurity fresher” and noted what I should not do at the beginning of my journey.
- Reflected on my own learning plan so that I focus on fundamentals, hands-on labs, and a clear path instead of just random courses or certificates.

### Day 21 – Dec 27, 2025 ✅
- Started going deeper into cyber security and networking concepts instead of just surface-level learning.
- Focused on understanding the “why” behind topics I have already seen, so that my fundamentals become stronger for future red-team and SOC work.

- ### Day 22 – Dec 28, 2025 ✅
- Spent time doing a small room makeover and organizing my study setup so I can focus better on cyber security.
- Because of this, I only ran three Linux commands today, but still touched Kali to keep the habit alive.

- Connected these concepts with my networking and Linux practice to understand how they apply in real cyber security jobs.

### Day 24 – Dec 30, 2025 ✅
- Did another revision session of all previous TryHackMe rooms and concepts to make sure everything stays fresh in my memory.
- Reviewed Red Team vs Blue Team roles, networking fundamentals, and Linux commands practiced so far.
- Focused on connecting all the topics together to build a stronger overall foundation before moving to more advanced rooms.
